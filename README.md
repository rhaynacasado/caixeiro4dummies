    <p> An Evolutionary Systems programming Project! 📦✈️❓ </p>
</h1>

## 🚨 About
In this project the system must fit the best way to its goal point by the applying evolutionary systems theory.

The path is evaluated by summing points as close as it gets to the goal and subtracting points as it gets distant to the goal or hits obstacles.

The evolution is made by exterminating the worst generated way and keeping the best ones. Then the chosen best are crossovered with the other generated ways. Finally, the path suffer a mutation to improve the system.
